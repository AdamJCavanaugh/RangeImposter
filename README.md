# 🎭 Range Imposter

**Range Imposter** is a browser-based party game of hidden questions and suspicious answers. One question goes to most players. A different question goes to a few. Everyone answers with a number—and then tries to guess who got the odd one out.

Built for in-person play on a single device, it's perfect for game nights, classrooms, or community groups.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Enter player names and start the game.
2. Each player taps their name to receive a question (either A or B).
3. They enter a number based on their question.
4. Once all answers are submitted, the group discusses who might be the imposters.
5. Reveal the questions and see who got what!
